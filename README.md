# Friendst_Tacking
This app is designed to help the user manage who their friend is and who is not. Within the app, you can add information about your friends, such as their name, home address, email, photo, date of birth, and of course, classify them whether they are good friends or not. In addition to the app there is a convenient and beautiful menu that you can place the members of your choice or delete them by swiping left. When the user clicks on a particular friend then a new page will open with all the details of that friend and there he can click on various icons to open the required information (such as waze, phone and email).
